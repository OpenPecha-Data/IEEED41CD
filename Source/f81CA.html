	<h2>Song of the Enchanting Wildwoods</h2>
<p><strong><em>by Longchen Rabjam</em></strong></p>
<p>In Sanskrit: <em>sÄna-ÄnantavÄti</em><br/>
In Tibetan: <em>nags tshal kun tu dgaâ baâi gtam</em> </p>
<p>I prostrate to my guru and the Three Jewels! </p>
<p>Her form, a peaceful grove of fresh blossoms,<br/>
Pleasingly dappled with the soothing moonlight of compassion â<br/>
The sole restful tonic for those long exhausted â<br/>
I honor the miraculous wildwoods,<br/>
Which I see now as if for the first time. </p>
<p>Since I am broken-hearted here in the city of existence,<br/>
My mind sends these tidings its own way â<br/>
A story about resorting to the peaceful forest<br/>
For someone who will apply their heart to the Dharma path. </p>
<p>I see the truth that this life wonât last and is swiftly heading toward ruin,<br/>
That even this body which Iâve so lavishly cared for will be lost,<br/>
And Iâll have to head off alone to parts unknown.<br/>
So now, Iâm off to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>When I get distracted, I lose sight of the path to freedom â<br/>
Which is solely responsible for prolonging my saá¹sÄric suffering.<br/>
Now that Iâve seen the plague of conceptual thinking,<br/>
Iâm off to live in the unborn peace of the wildwoods.</p>
<p>The busy cities are bonfires of desire.<br/>
I see now that if I catch the terrible plague of existence,<br/>
Iâll just keep wandering in the canyons of saá¹sÄra.<br/>
So, Iâm off right now to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Every being in existence is threatened by affliction<br/>
And totally bound by terrifying chains of duality.<br/>
Because each one has at some point or another been my mother or father,<br/>
To free them, I must go to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>All these outer things we keep looking to<br/>
Are impermanent and completely unreliable â<br/>
Seeing how they change like autumn clouds,<br/>
My heart knows I must go to the peaceful wildwoods.</p>
<p>The sun of the good times of yore has set<br/>
And the moon of mean people is on the rise;<br/>
The darkness of evildoing mÄras closes in on all sides.<br/>
I see it, so I must go to the wildwoods <em>right now</em>. </p>
<p>People are so difficult to be with â<br/>
The good ones wonât lead the way, and the bad ones never stop.<br/>
At the slightest provocation, their mood can shift unpredictably.<br/>
No matter what I do, theyâre never satisfied.<br/>
So, I canât stay here â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>If I donât take charge of my own mind,<br/>
No one else is going to steer the course for me.<br/>
If Iâm really going to give the best counsel to my own mind, itâs this:<br/>
Donât stay here â you must go to the wildwoods. </p>
<p>Spending time with the spiritually immature diminishes my virtue<br/>
And certainly makes me more negative.<br/>
To make sure Iâm totally engaged in the positive,<br/>
From today on, I must go to the wildwoods. </p>
<p>These days, when you spend time with somebody,<br/>
You might make a quick friend,<br/>
But at a momentâs notice,<br/>
They can become as unbearable as an enemy.<br/>
Therefore, I canât stay â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Alas, even the light of the Sageâs teachings<br/>
Is drawing down upon the peaks of the western mountains.<br/>
Once it has set, the lionâs roar of the true Dharma<br/>
Will not be heard again.<br/>
So, Iâm off to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>When explained well, nobody pays attention.<br/>
Poor explanations contradict the true Dharma.<br/>
Since beings prefer to believe that the buddhas have taught only<br/>
That they should do what they like, and nothing else,<br/>
When I teach the real Dharma way, everyone reviles me like an enemy.<br/>
For whatever reason, when they teach non-Dharma these days,<br/>
People love it, even though it sends them off to the lower realms.<br/>
I simply canât understand what theyâre up to.<br/>
Seeing all this, since I aim to accomplish the benefit of beings,<br/>
I canât stay. I wonât stay. Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Even though your body is beautiful with discipline,<br/>
You soar on the wings of the three trainings,<br/>
And youâve plunged into the lotus lake of study and contemplation,<br/>
If you arenât also wealthy, everyone just reviles and ignores you.<br/>
The evil-acting irreligious rich are treated like gods.<br/>
This is an age when fools are marketed better than the holy ones.<br/>
Seeing these signs of the times, Iâm off to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Wherever I look,<br/>
Apart from people putting their energy into the material world,<br/>
Those practicing the Dharma path are as rare as a supernova.<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a><br/>
Having seen this to be true,<br/>
If Iâm going to accomplish the true Dharma,<br/>
I canât stay any longer â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Compared to those who seek distraction with every thought,<br/>
People who care for themselves according to the Dharma are altogether rare.<br/>
Those who actually practice it are bullied and disregarded.<br/>
Thus, I canât stay â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Even if you spend this life in introspection,<br/>
It passes so quickly, without pausing day or night.<br/>
Having seen that laziness always gets the better of my virtue<br/>
And that this mind wonât settle even a little,<br/>
Iâm off to the wildwoods right now.</p>
<p>Because Iâm distracted by the eight worldly concerns<br/>
Such as preferring praise to blame,<br/>
Even though I live spiritually, its all for this one life.<br/>
So, I canât stay â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>All the good times I had until yesterday<br/>
Are now as real as last nightâs dream,<br/>
Though sometimes they do become objects of pleasant nostalgia.<br/>
Seeing how meaningless this is, Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Even savoring my desires, I never feel content.<br/>
All the pleasures that Iâve experienced<br/>
From birth till now<br/>
Would not satisfy me, even if they returned.<br/>
This mind is addicted to desire.<br/>
If Iâm not even securing this lifeâs happiness in this way,<br/>
How will I ever achieve the nirvÄá¹a I seek<br/>
Which ensures benefit that lasts through all lives?<br/>
So, Iâm done following the desire highway.<br/>
O dear heart, we can do it:<br/>
Letâs abandon these desires and get to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Since all this thinking hasnât done me much good,<br/>
In order to grow accustomed to observing my own mind,<br/>
Iâm going today to the wildwoods,<br/>
Where you, dear mind, will realize lasting happiness.</p>
<p>Once Iâm lying on my deathbed,<br/>
Iâll have to leave everything behind and travel on â alone.<br/>
This time is certain to arrive before long.<br/>
So, right now, Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Because this time is incredibly degenerate,<br/>
Even if someone like me were to teach,<br/>
It wonât really benefit others.<br/>
Because I aspire to be of benefit to future ages,<br/>
I canât stay here â Iâm going to meditate in the wildwoods.</p>
<p>O mind, dismiss these preoccupations<br/>
That are of no help to yourself, and no help to others.<br/>
You must, from today forth,<br/>
Go to the wildwoods to meditate on the nature of mind<br/>
In order to accomplish what will definitely bring us benefit.</p>
<p>But absolutely, I make the noble heartfelt aspiration<br/>
That a time may come when I receive<br/>
The opportunity to be of benefit to others,<br/>
Accomplishing their needs on a vast scale<br/>
Without thinking of myself for even a moment.<br/>
Now though, if I have one thought in my heart,<br/>
Itâs this: donât wait â go meditate in the wildwoods right now.</p>
<p>In order to encourage those below me to listen<br/>
And especially uphold the buddhadharma,<br/>
My primary concern will be the exchange of the essential teachings.<br/>
This will spread the Sageâs doctrine<br/>
And increase the intelligence of my own mind.</p>
<p>Whatever I conceive of is impermanent and meaningless.<br/>
Even the best conditioned things are bound to fall apart.<br/>
Having seen this to be true,<br/>
I will seek the sacred undeceptive mind â<br/>
The essential and indestructible truth.</p>
<p>All the Dharma collections that the Sage has taught,<br/>
Come down to giving up desires<br/>
And settling evenly<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> in the peaceful truth â nothing else.<br/>
O mind, consider your mortality,<br/>
And be intent to go to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>The wildwoods have been universally praised by the victors.<br/>
So, they encourage anyone who has few desires and is rich in contentment<br/>
To go live in the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Now when thereâs all this unstable thinking,<br/>
The primary task is to settle mind inwardly.<br/>
For it projects itself toward objects in the midst of many distractions,<br/>
Unable to rest for even a moment.<br/>
Even if well-guarded, it follows compulsively after emotions.<br/>
Therefore, I canât stay here. Iâm going to meditate in the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Intellectually understanding phenomenaâs nature<br/>
And leaving them as mere objects of mindfulness is no help.<br/>
So, if Iâm going to become intimate with the true nature of phenomena,<br/>
I canât wait â I must go to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>The wilds naturally entail few distractions and obligations<br/>
And are free from the suffering of anxiety and adversity.<br/>
So today, be happy go to the peaceful wildwoods<br/>
Which far surpass the joys of the cities of the higher realms.</p>
<p>Well, my dear mind, listen now to the charms of the wildwoods: </p>
<p>Precious trees fit to offer to the victors,<br/>
Abound there, branches laden with fruit â<br/>
Their leaves and flowers fragrant and blossoming,<br/>
Graced with the scent of incense and mist on the breeze.</p>
<p>Cascades of water descend with the gentle rumble of bass drums.<br/>
The hills above are bathed in the coolness of the moon<br/>
And covered with a thick robe of clouds,<br/>
Above which shine the stars and constellations in their perfect beauty.</p>
<p>Flocks of geese glide above fresh smelling ponds and<br/>
Birds and deer roam freely about.<br/>
Bees buzz melodiously everywhere among the<br/>
Lotus and utpala flowers, among the wish-fulfilling trees.</p>
<p>The trees sway, dancing back and forth, back and forth,<br/>
And the tips of their branches bow,<br/>
As if lovingly welcoming guests,<br/>
Saying, âWeâre glad youâve come!â</p>
<p>The cool, pure ponds are covered with lotus flowers<br/>
Whose faces are bright as if smiling upon us.<br/>
Surrounding are groves of flowers and trees<br/>
And grassy meadows holding the robes of the sky.<br/>
All of this shining like the stars on a clear night<br/>
Or gods playing in pleasure groves.</p>
<p>While the cuckoo sings his intoxicating, piercing song,<br/>
And the flowers sway in the cool seasonal breeze,<br/>
Cloud-elephants trumpet their joy<br/>
And the appearance of rain heralds cooling goodness. </p>
<p>In all four seasons,<br/>
Guiltless subsistence can be had<br/>
From readily available fruit, leaves, and roots. </p>
<p>In the woods, the afflictions naturally subside<br/>
For there is no one to say unpleasant things.<br/>
Having gone far from busy cities,<br/>
In the woods, peaceful meditation naturally grows.<br/>
In the woods, the mind is tamed as it conforms to the true Dharma,<br/>
And one can find the bliss of inner peace.</p>
<p>In short, the charms of the wildwoods are endless â<br/>
Even if I had eons, I could not conclusively extol them.</p>
<p>The attainment of awakening by all the victors of the three times<br/>
Only occurs when staying in the wildwoods â<br/>
Never in stressful cities and countries.</p>
<p>Offering flowers and incense to all the buddhas<br/>
For eons as numerous as the grains of sand in the Ganges<br/>
Would bring but a fraction of the merit gained<br/>
From taking seven steps in the direction of retreat,<br/>
With the qualities of the wildwoods in oneâs mind.<br/>
I encourage you thus to contemplate the qualities of the woods<br/>
As detailed in the <em>Moon Lamp SÅ«tra</em>.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<p>Once youâve gone there, youâll live near caves and cliffs,<br/>
In areas rich with medicinal herbs, amidst flowers and trees,<br/>
Or in a simple thatched hut made of grass and leaves.<br/>
Youâll sustain yourself with the bare necessities<br/>
Such as water, kindling, and fruit<br/>
And have the space to apply yourself day and night to what is wholesome. </p>
<p>There, inspired by the turning of the leaves,<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
Beauty, health, and various abilities<br/>
All gradually changeâthat they lack solidity:<br/>
What is called âthe diminishing of oneâs assets.â</p>
<p>There, inspired by the falling of the leaves,<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
Friends, strangers, and even your own body<br/>
Are such that they separate,<br/>
Even if they are together now, for the moment:<br/>
What is called âthe reality of loss.â</p>
<p>There, inspired by the pond losing its lotus flowers,<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
All wealth, assets, and sensual objects<br/>
Are in the end changeable, lacking solidity:<br/>
What is called âthe exhaustion of what is amassed.â</p>
<p>There, inspired by the passing of the months and seasons,<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
Even this body, like the blooming flowers of late spring,<br/>
Changes with time, its youth passing:<br/>
What is called âthe arrival of the Lord of Death.â</p>
<p>There, inspired by the ripening and falling of fruit<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
Youth, the prime of life, and old age are just so,<br/>
That thereâs no certainty of when death will occur:<br/>
What is called âwhat is born is bound to die.â</p>
<p>There, inspired by reflections appearing in ponds,<br/>
Youâll realize with certainty that<br/>
As the diverse range of phenomena appear,<br/>
They lack inherent nature,<br/>
Just like illusions, mirages,<br/>
Or reflections of the moon in water:<br/>
What is called âempty of true existence.â</p>
<p>Having thus internalized the nature of all that is,<br/>
Sit upright on a comfortable seat, with the body at ease,<br/>
And cultivate bodhicitta, concerned with the needs of beings.</p>
<p>Donât dwell on the past or fantasize about the future,<br/>
Donât engineer this natural ongoing presence.<br/>
Donât direct the mind, or draw it within,<br/>
Just let it settle without distraction,<br/>
Resting without grasping or conceptually structuring this open clarity<br/>
That is vivid, quiet, lucid, illuminating.<br/>
This is the wisdom intent of the buddhas of the three times.</p>
<p>Other than settling, easily relaxed<br/>
In the innate experience of the way your mind abides â<br/>
Thereâs nothing you need to contemplate.<br/>
So, you can release the effort it takes to engineer it,<br/>
For it is not an object of conceptual elaboration â<br/>
It canât be conceived of or investigated.<br/>
Yet, it is the wisdom intent of all the buddhas.</p>
<p>Therefore, to quiet the tangled mess of thought,<br/>
All you need to do is look into the intimately peaceful nature of mind. </p>
<p>At the end of the session, dedicate without reifying the three spheres. </p>
<p>In between sessions,<br/>
Cultivate your appreciation of impermanence and death.<br/>
Conditioned things have no attainable essence and are rife with problems.<br/>
Consider how saá¹sÄraâs nature is also like this.<br/>
Once you have realized how the play of all external appearance<br/>
Are like dream or illusion,<br/>
Let everything be within the equality of the experiential dimension of space.</p>
<p>Donât affirm or reject anything.<br/>
Give up attempting to engineer experience.<br/>
By living in this fashion, anything that happens<br/>
Will help reveal the unborn and unceasing nature of mind,<br/>
Your innate nature, just as it is.</p>
<p>Also at night, when it is time to sleep,<br/>
Release your mind into a conceptually unstructured experience<br/>
Within the reality of its unborn nature.</p>
<p>When you wake and appearances dawn,<br/>
Repeatedly relate to them as being ineffable by nature like illusions. </p>
<p>Once you have seen this precious treasury of your mindâs nature<br/>
To be such that nothing need be added or removed,<br/>
You will cross the painful ocean of existence<br/>
To the simple experience of that which is eternally peaceful<br/>
And entails no suffering,<br/>
Arriving at the boundless state of buddhahood.</p>
<p>In the meantime, consider the magical play of concepts that occur<br/>
As the natural arising of your essence, to which you need not grasp.<br/>
Thoughts arise as the display of dharmakÄyaâs essence.</p>
<p>When appearances occur as you are up and about,<br/>
Think, âI will guide these beings.<br/>
May I be their protector, refuge, and friend.â<br/>
Once you have entrusted your mind to bodhicitta,<br/>
Bear in mind that your conduct should ideally be pure.<br/>
You neednât think about anything other than the needs of beings.<br/>
This is the miraculous tree of compassion,<br/>
Which nourishes the shoots of the omniscient victors.</p>
<p>This path surpasses the ÅrÄvakas and pratyekabuddhas.<br/>
For it is a great lake of innumerable qualities from which<br/>
The light of immeasurable compassion spreads â<br/>
The incredible source of the precious state of perfect buddhahood.</p>
<p>Nothing could be more incredible than this.<br/>
Thus, anyone who is wise<br/>
Should definitely go meditate in the wildwoods<br/>
To accomplish sublime and peaceful awakening.</p>
<p>If in this way I do not accomplish the Dharma now,<br/>
Later, who knows what direction Iâll head in<br/>
And how difficult it will be to reconnect with the path at that point.<br/>
Then, there will be nothing I can do.<br/>
So now, while I have the chance, I must apply myself to the Dharma.</p>
<p>Nobody knows for sure whether they will die today or tomorrow.<br/>
Nothing is totally reliable,<br/>
The Lord of Death is drawing ever nearer â<br/>
And I have no power to send him back.<br/>
So, quickly, quickly, Iâm off to meditate in the wildwoods.</p>
<p>When death comes,<br/>
None of our wealth, friends, or relatives<br/>
Will be of any help to us.<br/>
A real practitioner will have nothing to fear of death.<br/>
So, let death come quickly here â Iâm going to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>It wonât be long before everyone, everything, and I will all be gone.<br/>
This is certain to come to pass.<br/>
So I can accomplish a bit of the Dharma now,<br/>
Iâm definitely going to live in the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Those who live an ethically impeccable life with<br/>
Abundant study,<br/>
Good meditation,<br/>
Life in the wildwoods,<br/>
And training in what is virtuous<br/>
Shall fearlessly discover great joy in the face of death.</p>
<p>The cause of their joy is exactly life in the wilds.<br/>
Thus, I am leaving to meditate there.<br/>
Nobody could know for certain<br/>
If the time when I shall be no more will come tomorrow or not.<br/>
On the morning of my death,<br/>
Nothing will protect me other than the Dharma.<br/>
For the Dharma is my protector, my home, and my friend.<br/>
It points me to the fine manor of the higher realms.</p>
<p>Thus, mind, remember that death is coming!<br/>
I must go to live in the wildwoods for the love of Dharma. </p>
<p>My mind sent this letter to itself.<br/>
Mind, if youâre listening, you are fortunate in the Dharma.<br/>
This message, spoken for your benefit, came straight from the heart.<br/>
Mind, take it, and head to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>This song of the enchanting wildwoods<br/>
Was penned by the man from SamyÃ©<br/>
Whose mind was turned to liberation by renunciation,<br/>
On the highest mountain peak of <em>Being at Ease in the Nature of Mind</em>,<br/>
So he would wholeheartedly head to the wildwoods.</p>
<p>Through any virtue arisen from this,<br/>
May all beings extract their minds from the city of saá¹sÄra<br/>
And find freedom all together<br/>
In the enchanting wildwoods of omniscient liberation. </p>
<p><em>This Song of the Enchanting Wildwoods was written by Ngagi Wangpo (Longchen Rabjam), the well-educated poet from glorious SamyÃ© Monastery, on the highest peak of the mountain when renunciation surged in him for our saá¹sÄric home.</em></p>
