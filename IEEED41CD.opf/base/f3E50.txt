Song Composed for Venerable Jinpa[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Namo guru!To primordially pure mind-as-such, Samantabhadra’s dharmakāya expanse,Which is and
always has been beyond union and separation, I pray:Inspire me to realize the perfect ground,
beyond transference or change,And to make manifest primordial liberation.

To the great, primordially perfect and spontaneously present character,The nature of radiant
clarity, unceasing sambhogakāya, I pray:Inspire me to reach the full measure of realizationOf
clear light that is present uninterruptedly throughout the three times.

To the nirmāṇakāya of rigpa’s radiance, its play of cognitive potency,The great liberation upon
arising of all that manifests, I pray:Grant me the assurance whereby saṃsāra and nirvāṇa
are naturally freedAnd the realization of nirmāṇakāya is made manifest just as it is.

Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö composed this in response to a request from the venerable Jinpa, which
was supported by the gift of an auspicious silken scarf and some silver.
