The Sweet Call of the Kalaviṅka

A Song Evoking the Omniscient King of Dharma

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

At the feet of the Father Guru, I pay homage.

Within the self-manifest expanse of five-coloured rainbow lightAbides the omniscient lord of
speech, Ngakgi Wangpo—His form, radiant and resplendent with the signs and marks,His speech,
ceaselessly proclaiming Dharma in Brahmā’s voice,And his mind never departing from meditative
equipoiseWithin the vajra-like expanse of all-pervasive luminosity.Embodiment of the
victors and their heirs throughout past, present and future,All-knowing protector, Dharma
lord, I remember you in the depths of my heart.

When the kingly eastern peak that towers over meadows and rocksIs transformed by the slow-moving
dance of white cloudsIn the clear blue sky that extends towards the azure heavens,All-knowing
lord, Dorje Ziji, I remember you.

As I recall you and exert myself in prayer,My heart is pierced by the great stake of devotion,And
I let out anguished sighs of unbearable longing.In my faith and ardour, the hairs of
my body stand on endAnd tears fall from my eyes.All-knowing father, primordial protector,Reveal
your smiling face, directly before my eyes!

In your form of pristine wisdom, which is immaterialAnd ablaze as if with a billion rays of
golden light,And with the sweet roar of profound, vast instruction,Waken me, here and now,
from the slumber of ignorance.

Let your heart’s spontaneously present sphere of five-coloured lightMerge, here and now, into
the centre of my own heart.Help me to see my true face, uncontrived and uncreated,The ground
that is the three-kāya guru of indivisible awareness and emptiness.Let whatever I experience
arise spontaneouslyAs adornments to the wheel of pristine wisdom,And let my practice
be enhanced through the activityIn which the naturally arisen is naturally freed without
grasping,So that the elaborate web of conditioned phenomena is absorbedWithin the great
dissolution into the ground of primordial purity.Then, as the array of kāyas and realms manifests
out of basic spaceMay I cause the six realms of saṃsāra to be emptied from the depths.


As I give voice to these words with the sweetest melody,Lord and all-knowing guru, inspire me
with your blessings.Your son, foolish old Lodrö, is tormented by evil karmaAnd calls out
to you in single-pointed devotion and prayer!

Composed on the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month of the Wood Dog.
