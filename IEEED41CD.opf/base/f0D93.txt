Spontaneously Arisen Song of Intense Sadness[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

May the misdeeds and sufferingOf all sentient beings, my past mothersWho are as infinite in
number as space is vast,All fall upon me.And may these maternal beingsGain whatever happiness
and virtue I possess.

I have taken birth countless times,But today my birth is of great significance,For I was born
as a child of the paternal line of vidyādharas.I encountered the teachings of the Victorious
One at an early age,Met a virtuous friend, the spiritual teacher,And received an ocean
of profound and vast Dharma instruction.Am I not fortunate, therefore, I wonder.

Then again, I reflect, although I’ve received Dharma teachings,I have not put even a single
word of them into practice.Instead I have spent my whole life consuming offerings,Bristling
with the sharp thorns of attachment and aversion,And creating causes for falling into the
lower realms in future lives.Thinking of this, my plight, excites the 'heart-wind' of depression.


My actions might seem positive but I’m truly a wrongdoer.Although I have the name of an emanationOf
the great all-knowing lord, it makes very little difference.Although I’ve been labelled
as one who serves the teachings,I wonder if I’ve actually done more to disgrace them.Reflecting
on this more and more, I'm moved to tears.

Then again, I reflect, everything is illusory;The essence of the illusory is emptiness;All that
is empty is interdependent;The interdependence process is beyond expression;And any partial
understanding I might haveOf this dharmatā nature, which is inexpressible,Comes from
the kindness of my father-guru.Even this is enough to brighten my mood.

Now, for whatever remains of this life,Let me not succumb to harmful actions.In your compassion,
protect me, miscreant as I am.May whatever actions I carry out be of benefit to others.May
all with whom I’m connected be reborn in the Blissful Land!

Thus, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month in the Bird year,[2] when I had fallen sick
and was feeling intense sadness as result of the various ills of the present age, these words
arose spontaneously.
