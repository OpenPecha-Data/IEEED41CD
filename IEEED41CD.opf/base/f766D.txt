Song Composed for Jamyang Chöpel[1]

by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

To the noble gurus, I pray.May the root guru in particular inspire me with his blessings.Father,
look upon me, with compassion, from the invisible realm.Lead this son of yours out of
the ocean of saṃsāra, I pray.

Inspire me to recollect impermanence and death.Inspire me to see the defects of saṃsāra.Inspire
me to adopt and avoid certain causes and their effects.Inspire me to make the most of
the freedoms and advantages.

Inspire me to develop confidence and trust.Inspire me to recognize the threefold refuge within.Inspire
me to perfect the two types of bodhicitta.

Inspire me to establish a foundation of devotion.Inspire me to maintain pure samaya commitments.Inspire
me to see the guru as the Buddha.Inspire me so that whatever I perceive may arise
as the guru.

Inspire me to realize appearances as the mind.Inspire me to realize mind itself as illusory.Inspire
me to realize the absence of any true nature.Inspire me to realize emptiness beyond
expression.

Inspire me so that my own mind may arise as the deity’s form.Inspire me to recognize all sounds
as mantra.Inspire me to recognize aware-emptiness as dharmakāya.

Inspire me so that all dualistic thought may dissolve.Inspire me so that the marks of conceptuality
may naturally subside.

Inspire me so that prāṇa-mind may dissolve in the central channel.Inspire me so that the four
kāyas may be made manifest.

Pray in this way.

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this at the request of Jamyang Chöpel.
